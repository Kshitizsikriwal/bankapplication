The Horizon Reserve Online Banking Application. Developed using TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN, this application is fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices (though the mobile version currently does not support multiple account connections).

With Horizon Reserve, you can securely connect multiple bank accounts, leveraging the Appwrite database, Plaid banking functionality, and Dwolla environment. To explore this application, please click the link provided and create a test account by signing up https://horizonreserve.netlify.app/

For the sign-up process, please ensure the following:

- The state must be "US" (for testing purposes).
- The postal code must be 5 digits.
- The SSN number must be 4 digits (you can enter any numbers).
- Your date of birth must indicate you are over 18 years old.
- Provide a unique email address and password.

After signing up, wait for the prompt to connect an account. Select any bank (e.g., Bank of America), and use the following credentials:

- Username: user_good
- Password: user_pass

Continue to login, skip entering a mobile number by clicking "Get Code" (as this is a test sign-up), submit an empty code, then choose Plaid checking and Plaid saving accounts. Accept the terms and conditions, continue, and wait a few seconds until it shows "Connect Bank" again. You will then be logged into the test environment.

Please note that in the desktop version, you can connect multiple accounts. This feature will soon be available on mobile devices as well. If the desktop site appears oversized, please reduce the zoom level to 80%.
